# SensorBot
This project intends to create a scene/robot for practising and testifying state estimation and decision making algorithms with sensor fusion.

The project is currently pure simulation-based, but will later include real world testing components as well as digital twin features.

P.S. The soul purpose for the robot's existence is its sensors, thus is given the name "SensorBot".
